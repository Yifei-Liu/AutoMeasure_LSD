# AutoMeasure_LSD
Automatic Measurement of Character Parameters of the Rapeseed Plant via Image Line Detection

This is the source codes for paper "A new line detection algorithm - Automatic measurement of character parameter of rapeseed plant by LSD" which is published in 4th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics.

This paper proposes a new method to measure character parameters of rapeseed plant automatically by geometric analysis and Line Segment Detector (LSD)[1]. The implemenation of LSD algorithm is showed in _lsd2.m_ file (the copyright belongs to original authors). Using _main.m_ to extract line segments of plant images.

Some sample images can be found in images folder. If you want to apply to other plant images, please make sure the photos are taken by high resolution cameras.
