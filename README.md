Automatic Measurement of Character Parameters of the Rapeseed Plant via Image Line Detection

This is the source codes for paper "A new line detection algorithm - Automatic measurement of character parameter of rapeseed plant by LSD" which is published in 4th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics.

This paper proposes a new method to measure haracter parameter of rapeseed plant automatically by geometric analysis and Line Segment Detector (LSD)[1]. The implemenation of LSD algorithm is showed in lsd2.m file (the copyright belongs to original authors). Using main.m to extract line segments of plant images.
